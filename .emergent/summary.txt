The trajectory outlines the iterative frontend development of a Pilgrimage Booking Platform. The AI engineer began by building a complete, multi-page frontend based on mock data, following the user's initial detailed specifications. This included setting up pages for home, search, groups, packages, and a Ziyarat guide, and ensuring functionality like RTL language support.

Following the initial build, the user made several requests for enhancements. The engineer first improved the home page's UI/UX, then built a more sophisticated search widget with advanced guest and flight options. A subsequent request for more UI enhancements led to a significant debugging effort where a newly created file () with syntax errors was abandoned in favor of augmenting the existing, stable  page.

The development pivoted when the user requested the implementation of advanced visual effects, but was immediately interrupted by a higher-priority task: to create a detailed Iraq Ziyarat Guide by analyzing a user-provided PDF. The engineer faced technical issues extracting data from the large file and instead generated the content from its knowledge base. The user then pointed out missing data and requested a more thorough analysis of the PDF. The work concluded with the engineer about to re-attempt the data extraction.

The user's primary language is English. Future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a responsive frontend for a unique, calm, and trustworthy online pilgrimage booking system for Shia Ziyarats in Iran and Iraq.

**Core Features & Pages:**
-   **Home Page:** Hero search widget (Hotels/Flights), upcoming groups, featured packages, and Ziyarat guides.
-   **Search Results:** Filterable, sortable lists for hotels and flights with a map view.
-   **Detail Pages:** For hotels, flights, and group departures.
-   **Packages:** Listing and detailed itinerary pages.
-   **Ziyarat Guide:** A comprehensive, interactive guide for key cities (Karbala, Najaf, etc.), built from a user-provided PDF. It must include shrine details, visiting info, practical tips, and prayers.
-   **User Accounts:** Dashboard for managing bookings.

**Technical & UX Requirements:**
-   **Stack:** React with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Design:** Mobile-first, responsive, and accessible (WCAG AA). The visual style is specified as calm and respectful, using deep navy, soft gold, and warm neutrals.
-   **Localization:** Must support English, Farsi (FA), and Arabic (AR) with full Right-to-Left (RTL) layout support.
-   **Data:** Initially built with mock data, with a recent focus on populating the Iraq Ziyarat Guide with authentic data from a PDF.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework/Libraries:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS,  for icons.
- **UI Components:** Utilizes pre-built  components located in .
- **State Management:** Component-level state (, ) and custom hooks (e.g., ).
- **Development Pattern:** Frontend-first with mock data. API contracts are planned but not yet implemented.
- **Routing:** Single Page Application (SPA) using  for client-side navigation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React project structure. All frontend code is located within the  directory.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance:** This is the main entry point for routing. It uses  to define all application routes, mapping URLs like , , and  to their respective page components.
    -   **Changes:** It has been repeatedly modified to add new routes for newly created pages, most recently for the  and to switch the home page from the initial version to .

-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/EnhancedHome.js**
    -   **Importance:** This is the current, active home page of the application. It aggregates multiple components like the header, the enhanced search widget, and various content sections.
    -   **Changes:** This file was created to provide a better UI/UX than the initial home page. It was later modified to incorporate additional components like  and a  after a failed attempt to create an .

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/EnhancedSearchWidget.js**
    -   **Importance:** This component provides the advanced search functionality on the home page, including tabs for Hotels/Flights, a complex guest/room selector, and a date range picker.
    -   **Changes:** Created to replace the initial, simpler search widget based on a user request for more advanced features.

-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/IraqZiyaratGuide.js**
    -   **Importance:** A newly created page designed to be an interactive and comprehensive guide to pilgrimage sites in Iraq. It sources its information from .
    -   **Changes:** This file was created from scratch to fulfill a specific user request.

-   **/app/frontend/src/data/iraqZiyaratData.js**
    -   **Importance:** This file acts as a mock database for the Iraq Ziyarat Guide. It contains a structured JavaScript object with details about cities, shrines, practical tips, and more.
    -   **Changes:** This file was generated by the AI based on its knowledge after failing to parse the user's PDF. It was later debugged to fix a syntax error. The current task is to update this file with more detailed data from the PDF.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Advanced Visual Effects:** The user selected several advanced effects (Hero Video Background, Parallax Scrolling, 3D Card Effects, etc.). The AI created the initial hook and component files for these but was interrupted before integrating them into the home page.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on enhancing the **Iraq Ziyarat Guide**. The previous AI engineer attempted to create this guide by analyzing a 165MB PDF () provided by the user. The data extraction failed due to tooling limitations (). As a workaround, the engineer generated the guide's content () and the corresponding page () from its own knowledge base.

However, the user reviewed the generated page and found it incomplete, specifically requesting a more detailed analysis of the PDF to add missing data, including prayers. The last action from the AI was to acknowledge this request and state its intention to extract more detailed information from the PDF to update the data comprehensively. The current task is to retry this data extraction and update  accordingly.

Re-attempt to extract detailed information from the provided PDF () to comprehensively update the  file with all missing data, including prayers, as requested by the user.

User Request: did u analyse the whole pdf as some datas not there please analyse in detail and update data which note there please update prayers too

AI's Last Action: Let me extract more detailed information from the PDF and update the data comprehensively:
