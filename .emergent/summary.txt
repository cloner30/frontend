The trajectory chronicles the development of a Pilgrim Portal frontend application, starting from a feature-poor MVP and evolving it into a rich, interactive user experience. The work was highly iterative and driven by direct user requests.

The initial major task was creating a comprehensive Iraq Ziyarat Guide by extracting data from a PDF, structuring it into a large mock data file (), and building a sophisticated UI () with tabs and modals to present the information effectively.

Subsequent work involved enhancing core product pages. The AI engineer implemented significant improvements for Hotel Search Results, Hotel Details, and Group Departure pages, each time expanding the mock data and creating new, feature-rich components. A complex, multi-step Plan Your Own Trip feature was also built from scratch, including debugging a React hook violation.

The engineer then performed UI/UX refinements, including a global update of the accent color and a complete redesign of the home page search widget () to be more compact and user-friendly.

The most recent and current task is the ground-up creation of a full-featured Admin Panel for content management. This involved setting up a new routing structure with dedicated layouts for public and admin areas, building the login page and dashboard, and beginning the implementation of the individual content management pages. The development is currently in the middle of building out the admin sections.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a feature-rich, responsive frontend for a pilgrimage booking platform (Ziyarat Portal). The application should feel professional, trustworthy, and visually calm.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Comprehensive Iraq Ziyarat Guide:** An interactive guide with information on cities, holy sites, practical laws, scholars, and Arabic prayers with translations, all extracted from a user-provided PDF.
*   **Enhanced Hotel & Group Tour Pages:** The application features redesigned and enhanced listing and detail pages for hotels and group tours, complete with advanced filtering, detailed information, and image galleries, all powered by extensive mock data.
*   **Custom Trip Planner:** A powerful, multi-step Plan Your Own Trip feature allowing users to select dates, cities, hotels, and day-wise activities (suggested from the Ziyarat Guide data) to build a custom itinerary with dynamic cost estimation.
*   **Enhanced Home Page:** The landing page features a highly user-friendly, multi-tabbed search widget for hotels, flights, and group tours.

**In-Progress Feature:**
*   **Admin Panel:** A secure, dedicated section for administrators to manage frontend content, including the Ziyarat Guide, home page reviews/offers, and SEO settings. The UI/UX foundation, login, and dashboard are complete.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework/Libraries:** React, React Router,  (icons).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, including direct color value replacement using  for theme updates.
- **UI/UX Patterns:**
    - Component-based architecture with separate layouts for Public and Admin sections (, ).
    - Multi-step forms for complex user flows (e.g., Plan Your Trip).
    - Conditional rendering to differentiate UI (e.g., search bar tabs).
- **State Management:** Component-level state using  and .
- **Data Handling:** All application content is driven by mock data from a central  file.

<code_architecture>
The application is a client-side rendered React app built with . The architecture was recently refactored to support a separate admin area using distinct layouts.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
    - **Importance:** The main application router. It orchestrates which layout (public or admin) and which page to render based on the URL.
    - **Changes:** This file was completely rewritten from a simple list of routes to a more sophisticated structure that uses the  hook to conditionally render either the  (containing the  and ) or the  for routes prefixed with . This was a critical architectural change to support the admin panel.

- ** & **
    - **Importance:** These new files establish a clean separation between the user-facing site and the back-office admin panel.  contains the admin sidebar and main content area, while  wraps the public pages.
    - **Changes:** Created to solve routing and layout conflicts when introducing the admin panel.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main landing page for the admin panel after successful login. It displays key stats and quick actions.
    - **Changes:** Created as a new file, it serves as the central hub for the admin experience, featuring a professional UI with data cards and navigation links.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The new, user-friendly search component on the home page.
    - **Changes:** Created to replace the previous version which was deemed too big. This version features a compact, single-row design, conditional fields for Hotels vs. Flights, and an improved date range picker. It also addresses a bug by correctly positioning the calendar icon.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A major feature implementation providing a multi-step custom trip planning flow.
    - **Changes:** This complex component was created from scratch. Development involved fixing a significant Rendered more hooks than during the previous render error by moving  calls to the top level of the component, demonstrating an understanding of React hook rules.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the first content management page being built for the admin panel.
    - **Changes:** This file was the last one created in the trajectory, marking the beginning of the build-out of the specific admin functionalities.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Admin Panel Content Sections:** Build the UI and logic for the remaining admin pages: Home Content Manager, SEO Manager, and Settings.
- **Backend API Integration:** Integrate the frontend with the ACF Journeys API for dynamic data (Hotels, Packages, Group Departures, Flights, Users). This task was explicitly deferred.
- **Implement Advanced Visual Effects:** A low-priority task to add a Hero Video Background and Parallax Scrolling effects, for which files were previously created but not integrated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current work is **Phase 2 of the Admin Panel implementation**: building out the individual content management sections.

Following a user request for a complete admin system to manage frontend content, the foundational work (Phase 1) was completed. This included creating the routing structure in  with separate  and , and building the  and  pages. The routing was debugged to fix a blank page issue, resulting in a fully functional and accessible login and dashboard interface.

The work concluded immediately after successfully establishing this foundation. The last action taken was beginning Phase 2 by creating the file for the first management section: . The next step in the immediate plan was to create the . The system is now poised for the creation and implementation of all the specific content management UIs (Ziyarat Guide, Home Content, SEO, etc.) within the established admin framework.

<optional_next_step>
Continue with Phase 2 of the admin panel implementation by creating the  component, followed by the  and  pages, to complete the planned admin sections.
