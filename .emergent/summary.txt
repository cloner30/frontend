The trajectory documents an intensive, multi-phase development effort focused on building and refining a comprehensive Iraq Ziyarat Guide for a pilgrimage booking platform. The work began with a user request to populate the guide using a large PDF file. The AI engineer first overcame technical hurdles to extract text from the PDF, using command-line tools () after initial tool failures. It then wrote Python scripts to parse this text and structure it into a JSON format.

This structured data was used to massively expand a mock data file, . The development was highly iterative, driven by user feedback. The first version was functional but incomplete. A user request for a better UI led to the creation of an enhanced page (). Subsequent user feedback pointed out poor UX (scrolling issue) and missing data (prayers).

This triggered a major refactoring effort. The engineer implemented a complex modal/overlay system to fix the UX, a process that involved significant debugging of nested JSX syntax errors and build cache issues. Simultaneously, the engineer performed multiple, increasingly comprehensive data extraction passes on the PDF, adding practical laws, scholar biographies, and finally, full Arabic prayer texts with RTL support, after user clarification on copyright.

The trajectory concludes with the engineer acting on a new request to clean up the main home page () by removing outdated components.

The user's primary language is English. Future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The project goal is to build a responsive, trustworthy, and visually calm frontend for an online pilgrimage (Ziyarat) booking system for sites in Iran and Iraq.

**Core Features:**
- **Home Page:** A central hub with a search widget, featured packages, and guides.
- **Search & Detail Pages:** Standard listings and detailed views for hotels, flights, and travel packages.
- **Iraq Ziyarat Guide:** A key feature. This is an interactive, comprehensive guide built from a user-provided PDF. It must be mobile-first and include detailed information on holy sites (shrines, mosques), practical travel laws (Aḥkām), historical context, scholar biographies, and authentic prayer texts (Duas) in Arabic with translations.
- **User Accounts:** For managing bookings.

**Technical & UX Specifications:**
- **Stack:** React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Design:** A mobile-first, responsive design using a calm color palette (deep navy, soft gold, warm neutrals).
- **Localization:** Must support English and RTL languages (Farsi, Arabic). The Ziyarat Guide implementation has already addressed RTL for Arabic prayer texts.
- **Data Source:** Initially built with mock data, the primary development effort has been to replace this with authentic, structured data extracted from a provided PDF.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks:** React, React Router.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS,  for icons.
- **UI Components:**  and custom-built components.
- **Data Handling:**
  - Mock data management in a central JS file ().
  - PDF text extraction using  ().
  - Data structuring and parsing via Python scripts.
- **UI/UX Patterns:**
  - Single Page Application (SPA) routing.
  - Implementation of nested modals to improve user experience.
  - Right-to-Left (RTL) text rendering for Arabic content ().
- **State Management:** Component-level state with  and .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a standard client-side rendered React application. The code is located in the  directory.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the centerpiece of the recent development effort. It is the current, active page for the Iraq Ziyarat Guide, replacing a simpler version. It's designed to be highly interactive and data-rich.
  - **Changes:** This file was created and heavily modified. A complex tabbed interface was added to display different categories of data (Cities, Practical Laws, Scholars, Arabic Prayers). A nested modal system was implemented to show city and site details without forcing the user to scroll, which required extensive JSX debugging and state management. Specific styling for RTL Arabic text was also added.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file acts as the client-side database for the entire Ziyarat Guide. It exports JavaScript objects and arrays containing all content.
  - **Changes:** This file underwent massive expansion. It started as a small mock data file and was iteratively overwritten with comprehensive data extracted from a PDF. It now contains structured information on cities, holy sites, historical events, scholar biographies, practical laws, and full Arabic prayer texts with transliterations and translations.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the application's main landing page. It features the primary search widget and links to other key sections.
  - **Changes:** The most recent work involves modifying this file. The  component and a section linking to an old guide have been removed to declutter the page and direct users to the new, enhanced Ziyarat Guide.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main router for the single-page application.
  - **Changes:** This file was modified to update the route for  to render the newly created  component instead of the previous version.

- ** (multiple files)**
  - **Importance:** These Python scripts were temporary, single-use tools created to parse the raw text extracted from the PDF and structure it into a clean JSON format, which was then manually copied into .
  - **Changes:** Multiple versions were created to perform increasingly detailed data extraction, from basic city info to scholar biographies and finally to Arabic prayer texts.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Advanced Visual Effects:** A user request to add effects like Hero Video Background and Parallax Scrolling was started but interrupted. The files were created but not integrated. This is a lower-priority task.
- **Verify Home Page Edits:** The edits to remove components from the  page have been made but not yet tested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate last task was to modify the home page based on the user's request. The user asked to remove outdated content from the home page to clean up the UI and ensure users are directed to the newly completed Iraq Ziyarat Guide.

**Actions Taken:**
1.  **File Targeted:** .
2.  **Removal of Comparison Table:** The  component, which was previously displayed on the home page, was identified and removed. This included deleting the component's import statement and its JSX tag from the render method.
3.  **Update Ziyarat Guide Section:** The old Ziyarat guide section was replaced with a new, visually enhanced section. This new section now correctly links to the  route, which displays the  component, ensuring users access the latest, most comprehensive version of the guide.

The work concluded right after the  commands to perform these edits were successfully executed. The next logical step is to verify these changes.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Check for lint errors and then take a screenshot of the home page to verify that the  and the old guide link are gone, and the new guide section is displayed correctly.
