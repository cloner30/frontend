Practical Laws (Aḥkām) for Ziyārah
 It is mustaḥab to offer ṣalāh in the ḥarams of the Imāms (ʿa); in fact, it is better than
praying in a masjid because all of the ḥarams are, in fact, masājid.
 It is good to have ādāb (respect) and be careful not to pray “ahead” of the grave of
the Prophet (ṣ) and Imāms (ʿa) in a manner that would be considered disrespectful
to the owner of that grave.
 The ḥaram of Imām Ḥusayn (ʿa), Masjid al-Kūfah, Masjid al-Ḥarām, and Masjid
an-Nabī are the four places where a traveler can choose to pray a full prayer or
shortened prayer (please see individual chapters for a more detailed explanation).
 It is mustaḥab to enter the ḥarams of the Imāms or their descendants with wuḍūʾ.
 It is iḥtiyāt al-wājib (obligatory precaution) that a person who is in the state of
janābah, ḥayḍ, or nifās should not enter the ḥaram of a Maʿṣūm and remain
there (passing through is okay). The ḥaram, in this context, is that room that falls
underneath the dome, where the ḍarīh is built.

The Special Days of the Maʿṣūmīn
According to our aḥādīth, each day of the week has been dedicated to some of the
Maʿṣūmīn. It is recommended to visit the Maʿṣūm on that specific day and has more
thawāb. The days are as follows:






Saturday: Prophet Muḥammad (ṣ)
Sunday: Imām ʿAlī (ʿa) and Sayyidah Fāṭimah (ʿa)
Monday: Imām Ḥasan (ʿa) and Imām Ḥusayn (ʿa)
Tuesday: Imām as-Ṣajjād (ʿa), Imām al-Bāqir (ʿa), and Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa)
Wednesday: Imām Mūsā al-Kāẓim (ʿa), Imām ar-Riḍā (ʿa), Imām al-Jawād (ʿa),
and Imām al-Hādī (ʿa)
 Thursday: Imām Ḥasan al-Askari (ʿa)
 Friday: Imām al-Mahdī (ʿaj)

Ṣalāh of Ziyārah and the Gifted Ṣalāh
 Reciting the Ṣalāt al-Ziyārah has only
been recommended for the Maʿsūmīn
and a few others, such as Prophet Ādam
(ʿa), Prophet Nūḥ (ʿa), and the martyrs of
Karbalā.
 For everyone else, it is good to read a
Ṣalāh after ziyārah with the intention of
gifting the thawāb to their souls (e.g., the
other descendants of the Imāms (ʿa), the
scholars, parents, friends, relatives, etc.).

Ziyārat an-Niyābah 23

Ziyārat an-Niyābah
(Ziyārah on Behalf of Somebody)
 It is good to perform ziyārah on behalf of someone
else (whether they are alive or passed away).
 Both the nāʾib (the one performing the ziyārah) and
manūb ʿanhu (the one on whose behalf the ziyārah is
being performed) will gain the reward of the ziyārah.
 In aḥādith, it is mentioned that Dāwūd Surmī said
to Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa), “I have performed
the ziyārah of your father and have made a nīyyah
(intention) for the thawāb to be given to you.” The
Imām (ʿa) replied, “There is a supreme reward for you
from Allah, and from us, there is praise towards you.”
 In another narration, some of the Imāms were
asked, “Is there a reward for someone who offers a
two-rakaʿāt prayer, fasts for a day, performs Hajj or
ʿUmrah, or performs the ziyārah of the Prophet (ṣ) or
one of the Imāms (ʿa), and gifts that thawāb to their
mother, father, or brother/sister in faith?” In response,
it was said, “The thawāb of that action goes to the one
on whose behalf it was done without taking away any
thawāb from the one performing the action.”
 In the book Tahdhīb, Shaykh Ṭūsī mentions that the
performer (nā’ib) should recite the following salām at
the end of their ziyārah:

َ‫ا‬
َ‫ُ ا‬
َ‫َ ُ ا‬
َ‫َ َّ ا‬
َ َ
"‫لسل ُم َعلیْك یَا َم ْول َي ع ْن "فل ِن ب ْ ِن‏فل ٍن‬
‫ا‬

Peace be upon you, O my master, on behalf of
so-and-so.

َ َ ْ ُ َ‫ً َ ْ ُ َ ْ َ ْ ه‬
‫اتیتُك زائِرا عنه فاشفع‬
‫ل ِعند َر ِّبك‬

I have come to visit you on behalf of him/her, so intercede for him/her to
your Lord.
 Someone who would like to recite ziyārah on behalf of all of the believers
or a specific group of believers can make the nīyyah verbally or in his/her
heart before reciting the ziyārah.
 After the ziyārah is recited, offer a two-rakaʿāt prayer for the ziyārah and
recite the following:

ُ ْ ُ ِّ‫َ َّ ُ َّ ی‬
ْ‫ار َة َو َصلَّی‬

by Your mercy, O the Most Merciful!
َ َْ َ
َ ْ‫الراحمِ ین‬

Ṣalāh for Marḥūmīn 25
 After the duʿā, when you return and see one of these brothers and sisters in faith, say,
“I performed the ziyārah of the Maʿṣūm on your behalf,” and this statement will be true.

Ṣalāh for Marḥūmīn
 According to aḥādīth, Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa) would
offer a two-rakaʿāt ṣalāh every night for his children
and every day for his parents. In the first rakʿah, he
would recite Sūrah al-Qadr after Sūrah al-Fātiḥah. In
the second rakʿah, he would recite Sūrah al-Kawthar
after Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, and gift the reward of this
prayer to their souls.
 In another ḥadīth from Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa), it is said
that the reward of an action done for those who have
passed away has rewards for the deceased, as well
as the one performing it.

Preparing for Your Journey
Dear Respected Zāʾir,
You are soon going to embark upon a journey, but this is no ordinary journey — this is a spirirual journey.
Just as you would prepare for any other trip, you must also prepare for this trip. However, this is different to
your typical vacation, and thus requires more preparation. You must ensure that you are prepared in every
way — mentally, spiritually, and physically.
Mental Preparation
Perhaps the most important prepartion for this trip is the mental preparation. As you embark on this spiritual
journey, you will be visiting a country that is very different to your home country. Therefore, the circumstances,
customs, culture, climate, and weather will all be different. Since this is a journey of self-development and
perfection, you must expect that conditions may be difficult and challenges may occur. Therefore, you must
shift your perspective and have a positive outlook, for if you do not go in with this mindframe, you may miss
the true beauty of ziyārah and not enjoy it the way you should. If you go in with the correct mindset, however,
you will view each challenge as being beautiful in its own way, for it is a stepping stone in helping you attain
that spiritual perfection you are seeking. Therefore, the key is to be prepared for the challenges ahead.
Being in another country, you will see that people have different customs and cultures, so you must be openminded, flexible, forgiving, and positive. Do not be overwhelmed; rather than dwelling on these differences,
appreciate them. There may be a language barrier, but still try to communicate with others by focusing on
your similarities, namely your love for the Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa).
Spiritual Preparation
Before embarking on this journey, try to strengthen your spiritual health so that your soul can truly benefit.
Some ways to do this include:
Listening to lectures and majālis
Reading about the history and culture of the places you are about to visit
Learning about the history of the Imāms you will be visiting
Perform aʿmāl or acts of worship and gifting it to the Imāms you will be visiting
Listening to or reciting duʾās and Qurʾān
Equipping yourself with tawakkul and ikhlāṣ

Preparing for Your Journey 27
Physical Preparation
As there will be a lot of walking and physical exertion, you must take care of your health and physically
prepare yourself for this journey. Additionally, remember that the weather may be different, so prepare
accordingly.

Making the Most of Your Journey

Bonding with Your Family
If travelling with your family, take this opportunity to strengthen your bonds and become closer to each other.
Make this a joyful and memorable experience for your family. The Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa) are a source of love, and
we need to be a source of love for our families. How can you do this?
 Hold your children's hands as you walk to the ḥaram.
 Sit with your children and recite duʾās with them.
 Have good conversations with your children in the ḥaram; this is worship, too!
 Keep a light atmosphere and joke with your family.
 Teach your children about the great personalities you are visiting and why you are visiting them.
