An Illustrated Ziyārah Guide to Irāq: Sāmarrā

Sāmarrā
Dear Zāʿir,
You have now entered the city of Sāmarrā. As you walk through this city, be aware
that this the same land where our beloved 10th, 11th, and 12th Imāms (ʿa) lived and
were under house arrest. This is the place where our living Imām (ʿa) was born and
last seen before he entered into ghaybah (occultation). Make sure to especially pray
for his quick reappearance, and for your families and communities to be included
amongst his close companions and supporters.
The city of Sāmarrā is unique in that both Shīʿah and Sunnī populations peacefully
coexist in this locale. This is because they have found firm unity through their love
for the Imāms (ʿa) who reside in this land.
In this ḥaram, you will find one big darīḥ that has four holy graves within it:
• Imām ʿAlī al-Hādī (ʿa)
• Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa)
• Ḥaḍrat Hakimah Khātūn (The sister of the 10th Imām)
• Ḥaḍrat Narjis Khātūn (The mother of the 12th Imām)

Sāmarrā
Ṣalāh of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa)

Offer a two-rakaʿāt prayer in the
following method:
• 1st Rakʿah: Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and
Sūrah Yāsīn
• 2nd Rakʿah: Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and
Sūrah ar-Raḥmān

349

Ṣalāh of Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa)

Offer two sets of two-rakaʿāt in the
following method:
• 1st set: Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and Sūrah
al-Zalzalah 15 times
• 2nd set: Sūrah al-Fātiḥah and
Sūrah al-Ikhlāṣ 15 times

Virtues of Performing Ziyārah
of ʿAskarīyayn (ʿa)
Without a doubt, the rewards and virtues
of performing the ziyārah of the 10th and
11th Imāms (ʿa) is equivalent to that of
the other Imāms (ʿa).
Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa):
The one who performs ziyārah of any
of the Imāms (ʿa) is like one who has
visited and performed ziyārah of the
Noble Prophet (ṣ).
Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa):
Whoever performs ziyārah of an Imām
(ʿa), whom it is mandatory to follow, and

offers a four-rakaʿāt prayer in his ḥaram will
be given the reward of performing Ḥajj and
ʿUmrah.
ʿAllāmah Majlisī has reported 15 aḥādīth
in regards to the rewards for rebuilding the
graves of the Prophets and the Imāms. Some
of these aḥadīth are below:
1. Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa): My grave
in “Sorra man rāʾ1" is a source of safety
(from divine punishment) for both groups.
The two groups are the Shīʿah and Sunnī
groups who were living there at the time,
implicating that the Imām’s (ʿa) holy grave
has such magnificent blessings that it has
covered the entire region and is a general
mercy for all.
1 Sorra man rāʾ was the original name of
Sāmarraā.

2. Shaykh Ṭusī narrates in Amālī that someone asked Imām al-Hādī (ʿa): O my master!
Teach me a duʿā through which I may gain closeness to Allah, the Exalted. The Imām
(ʿa) replied, "I will teach you a duʿā that I recite many times and call upon Allah with. I
have asked Allah not to disappoint anybody who recites this duʿā at my shrine:
O my means when I lack means. O
my hope and trust! O my shelter and
support!
O the One! O the Only! O [He who is
described in the verse] "Say: He is
Allah, the One."
I ask you, O Allah, by the right of those
whom you have created and have not
made anyone like them
to send blessings upon all of them and
grant me...[ask for your wishes]

3. It's been narrated in ʿUddat al-Dāʿī that one person had a difficult problem during
the time of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa). So, he asked Imām (ʿa) to
intercede on his behalf to the khalīfah. Before long, his
problem was resolved, so he came to Imām (ʿa) and asked,
"Did you intercede for me at his palace?" The Imām (ʿa)
replied, "Allah has trained us in a way that we only seek
His help during difficult hardships and do not ask anybody
else for help. I was afraid that if I took your request to the
khalīfah, the Almighty would remove His Mercy from us,
so I asked Him to grant blessings to those who recite this
duʿā at my shrine and accept their call." The Imām (ʿa) then
recited the above duʿā.

History of Sāmarrā'
• Sāmarrā is located on the east bank
of the Tigris River in the Ṣalāḥuddīn
Province, 78 miles north of Baghdād.
• Due to the good weather, the Sasanian
Kings had erected some buildings here.
• Sāmarrā used to be the border city
between the Persian and Roman
empires. The Romans had control over
it; therefore, its people were Christians.
• After the revelation of Islam, the city was
conquered from the Romans through
various battles, and was destroyed,
leaving its people scattered.
• By the end of the 2nd century, there was
only one temple left standing in this city.
• This city was famous even before the

Muslims took over.

In the year 221 AH, Muʿtaṣim, the 8th ʿAbbāsid
khalīfah, rebuilt the city and appointed it as his
capital. He named it “Sorra man rāʾ,” which means
“Whoever sees it will become happy.”

• This name was engraved on the ʿAbbāsid
coins during that time.
• From the death of Muʿtaṣim until 279 AH,
seven ʿAbbāsid khalīfahs also selected
Sāmarrā as their capital and constructed
many buildings around it.
• Sāmarrā was extended during the time
of al-Mutawakkil, and a new city named
Mutawakkiliya was established next to it.
• Once the capital of the khalīfahate was
moved back to Baghdād, Sāmarrā’s
development slowed down.
• Some of the magnificent buildings of
Sāmarrā existed until the 4th century.

History of Sāmarrā'

Aerial view of Sāmarrā

• During the 4th century, the
city of Sāmarrā was slowly
destructed, and nothing
remained except for the Holy
ʿAskarīyayn Shrine.

The Bombing of The ʿAskarīyayn Site
Near the end of February 2006, due to the poor security situation, the former
regime, assisted by foreigners from al-Qaeda, committed the biggest crime in
the history of the Sāmarrā Site, namely the tragedy of bombing the shrine and
its honorable dome, which is the biggest violation of their sanctity. It was a great
loss for the people of Sāmarrā, in particular, and for the Iraqis and all Muslims
in general. From an archaeological point of view, the building of this shrine was
the oldest among the holy shrines of Iraq. It dates back to more than a thousand
years.
In June 2007, Terrorists from Al-Qaeda destroyed the minarets of the Holy Shrine.
In April 2008, the members of the Ḥusaynī and ʿAbbasī holy shrines, with the
help of the Technical Committee for the Reconstruction of the ʿAskarīyayn shrine
combined their efforts to aid the ʿAskarīyayn site. The construction started in 2010
by expanding the courtyard of the ʿAskarīyayn (a), 100% horizontally and 200%
vertically. The new courtyard consists of two floors.

Muḥammad and his household
and send blessings upon ʿAlī, son of
Muḥammad, the guiding, nurturing,
infallible guide, who is pure from defects.
He cut off hope from anyone except You,
was afflicted with temptations, was tried
with tribulations,
was tested with beneficial trials and
through patience against complaining.
(He is) the spiritual guide of Your servants,
the blessing for Your lands, the store of
Your mercy,
the storehouse of Your wisdom, the guide
to Your paradise, the most knowledgeable
amongst Your creations, and the true guide
of Your creatures,
whom You pleased, preferred, selected
to take the place of Your Messenger, and
entrusted with the protection of his laws.

So, he fulfilled the heavy task, bore it
perfectly, and undertook the responsibility
of bearing it.
He neither slipped in any difficulty, nor did
he fail to solve any complexity. Rather, he
relieved all distress, clarified any confusion,
and fulfilled his responsibilities.
O Allah, just as You made him a source
of delight for Your Prophet, also raise his
rank,
give him the most fitting reward that suits
him, bless him, convey our greetings and
peace to him,
and give us, on account of our love for
him, from Your special bounties, favors,
goodness, forgiveness, and pleasure.
Surely, You are the Lord of supreme grace.

re-unify me [with my family], unite me [with
my family], purify my deeds,
do not cause my heart to stray after You
have guided me, do not cause not my
footstep to slip,
do not leave me to myself even for even

do not disappoint my hopes, do not expose
my secrets,
do not uncover my covering, do not cause
me to feel lonely, do not cause me to

O Light! O Evident! O Granter of Light! O

[He is the one] through whom our Lord shall
restore Islam after it has been buried and
He shall recover the Qurʾān after it has been
neglected.
I bear witness, O my master, that you
established the prayers, gave alms, enjoined
good, forbade evil,
called to the way of your Lord with wisdom
and good admonitions, and that you
worshipped Allah sincerely until certainty
(death) came upon you.
I ask Allah by the standing that you have
with Him that He accepts my visit to you,
accepts my efforts with gratitude, responds
to my prayers through you,
and include me with the supporters of
the truth, its followers, its adherents, its
devotees, and its lovers.

following duʿā:
O Allah, send blessings upon our master
Muḥammad and his Ahl al-Bayt,
and send blessings upon al-Ḥasan, son of
ʿAlī, who guides to Your religion and invites
to Your path.
He is the banner of true guidance, the lantern
of true piety, the core of rationale,
the source of reason, the raining cloud (of
goodness) over mankind,
the cloud of wisdom, the ocean of admonition,
the inheritor of the Imāms (ʿa), the infallible
and well-mannered witness over the
community,
the virtuous, the close one (to Allah), the
purified against impurity,
the one who inherited knowledge of the book
and whom You inspired with clear judgment.

Then offer a two-rakaʿāt prayer of ziyārah. After the salām, recite the following duʿā:
O All-eternal Lord! O Everlasting! O Everliving! O Self-subsisting! O Dispeller of
hardships and grief!
O Reliever of sadness! O Appointer of
Messengers! O Truthful to His promises!
O Ever-living! There is no god except You. I
intercede to You through Your beloved one,
Muḥammad, and his successor, cousin, and
son in-law, ʿAlī,
through both of whom you have completed
your laws and opened the door to
interpretation and analysis.

So, send upon both of them blessings that
are witnessed by the ancient and coming
generations, and through which the intimate
servants and the righteous ones are saved.

I also intercede to You through Fāṭimah azZahrāʾ, the mother of the rightfully guided
Imāms, and the leader of the women of the
worlds,
who shall be allowed to intercede for the
Shīʿah of her pure descendants. So, send
upon her blessings that are as endless as
time.
I also intercede to You through al-Ḥasan,
the pleased, the immaculate, and the pure,
and through al-Ḥusayn, the oppressed, the
pleased, the pious, and God-conscious;
(they both are) the masters of the youth of
paradise,

the two virtuous, immaculate, Godconscious, pure, immaculate, martyred,
oppressed, and murdered Imāms.
So, send blessings upon them whenever
the sun rises and sets, blessings that are
consecutive and successive.

religion,

weaken Your enemies, make Your intimate
servants inherit the lands of Iblīs and his
followers, destine the followers of Iblīs to
remain in the blazing fire forever, make them
taste the painful torment,
and place Your curses on those people who
spend their time in corrupt places and have
left the realm of the fiṭrah (divine nature),

and as a result, they will have removed
themselves from the mercy of Allah, and
remain there day and night.
O our Lord, grant us goodness in this world
and goodness in the hereafter, and save us,
out of Your mercy, from the punishment of
the fire. O the Most Merciful!

Common Ziyārah of Imām ʾAlī al-Hādī (ʿa) and Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa)
When you decide to perform the ziyārah of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) and Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa),
stand by the holy ḍarīḥ and recite:
Peace be upon you both, O the guardians
of Allah! Peace be upon you both, O the
proofs of Allah!
Peace be upon you both, O the lights of
Allah in the darkness of the earth!
Peace be upon you both, whose will was
the will of Allah.
I have come to visit you, aware of your
rights,
displaying hostility towards your enemies,
showing loyalty to those who are loyal to
you, believing in whatever you believed in,
disbelieving in whatever you disbelieved,
verifying that which you deemed true, and
invalidating that which you deemed wrong.

I ask Allah, my Lord and your Lord,
to make the reward of my visit to you be
given in the form of sending blessings
upon Muḥammad and his Household (as
that increases my reward)
and that He may grant me the favor of
accompanying you both in the gardens of
Paradise with your righteous fathers.

And I ask Him to save me from the hellfire,
to grant me your intercession and your
company, and that He may allow me to get
to know you better,

to never remove the love for you and your
righteous fathers from my heart,
not to make this my last visit to you,
and to include me with you all in paradise,
out of His Mercy.

Ḥaḍrat Hakimā
Khātūn (ʿa)
Ḥaḍrat Hakimā Khātūn is the
daughter of Imām al-Jawād
(ʿa), sister of Imām al-Hādī
(ʿa), and aunt of Imām Ḥasan
al-ʿAskarī (ʿa). Her holy grave
is located near the foot of
Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) and Imām
al-ʿAskarīi (ʿa) in Sāmarrā.
This noble lady witnessed
the Imāmate of four Imāms.
In addition, Imām al-Hādī
(ʿa) appointed her to be the

teacher of Ḥaḍrat Narjis
Khātūn, the mother of Imām
az-Zamān (ʿaj), so she could
learn about Islam. Even
after the martyrdom of Imām
Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa), She
also witnessed the birth of
Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj).
ʿAllāmah Majlisī says, “I
wonder why there is no
specific ziyārah for this
noble and pious lady,
despite her being among
true companions of the

Imāms (ʿa), being present at
the birth of Imām az-Zamān
(ʿaj), and constantly being
around Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa)
and being his intermediary after
his martyrdom. By the same
reasoning, Marḥūm Muḥaddith
Qummī mentions in Mafātīḥ
al-Jinān that it is proper to
recite her ziyārah using the
phrases that are used for her
aunt, Sayyidah Maʿṣūmah, the
daughter of Imām Mūsa bin
Jaʿfar (ʿa).

Holy Sardāb (Basement)
In Iraq, it was common to build
basements as shelters against
the heat. These basements
are called sardāb, and are
essentially
houses
built
underground that contain a
cold water fountain to keep the
home cool in the summer.
Imām al-Hādī’s (ʿa) house in
Sāmarrā was home to three
of the
Imāms (ʿa). They
spent many years living and
worshipping
the Almighty
in there. Hence, it is very
significant for the Shīʿāh and
lovers of the Imāms (ʿa).
The sardāb is located on
the northwest side of the
holy shrine and has recently
undergone major construction.
The sardāb is only considered
sacred due to the previous
presence of the Infallibles (ʿa)
in it, but it is not considered to
be the place of occultation.

Many people claim that this was the last place where
the 12th Imām was seen.

Best Time to Perform the Ziyārah of Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj)
Sulaymān ibn ʿĪsā narrates from his father:
I asked Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa), “When I am incapable of visiting you physically, then
how can I offer my ziyārah?”
The Imām (ʿa) replied, “O ʿĪsā! If you are unable to come to us, perform a ghusl or
wuḍū on Friday and stand under the sky and offer a two-rakaʿāt prayer. Then, focus
your attention towards me. Whoever visits me during my lifetime is like one who has
visited me after my lifetime, and whoever performs my ziyārah after my lifetime is
like one who has visited me during my lifetime!”
Based on this ḥadīth, it is clear that one can perform ziyārah of the living Imām
at any time and in any place. While we should perform ziyārah of our Imām (ʿaj)
everyday, we should at least offer our greetings on Friday, as this day holds special
significance.
Nasir Makarim Shirazi, Mafātīḥ Nawīn, Pg 243,

Ziyārah of Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj)

Ziyārah of Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj)
O Allah, certainly, I am standing at one of the
many doors of the house of your Prophet,
may Your blessings be upon him and his
household.

Certainly, it is impermissible for people to
enter except with his permission.

For You have said, "O you who believe! Do
not enter the houses of the Prophet, except
when you have been given permission."
O Allah, certainly I believe in the sanctity of
the owner of this noble place in his absence
the same way that I have believed in it in his
presence.
I know that Your messenger and
representatives, peace be upon them, are
always alive and are being sustained with
You.
They see where I am standing and hear my
words, and they reply to my greetings. And
certainly, You have concealed their words
from my ears,

understanding with pleasurable confidential

You, O my Lord, and secondly from Your
Messenger, may Your blessings be upon
him and his household.
Thirdly, I ask permission from Your
representative, the Imām whose obedience
is obligatory upon me, the Proof, son of
Ḥasan, al-Mahdī, may Allah hasten his
reappearance,
and the angels who have been appointed to
this blessed grave.

May I enter, O Messenger of Allah?
May I enter, O Proof of Allah?
May I enter, O close angels of Allah, who
have been appointed to this holy place?

So grant me permission, O my Master, to
enter in the best way that you have ever
allowed any of your intimate servants to
enter. So, if I am unworthy of this blessing,
You are worthy of giving it to me.

411

Sayyid Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī
Sayyid Muḥammad was a very noble man; because of
his virtuous traits, many Shīʿāh thought that he would
inherit the imāmate from Imām al-Hādī (ʿa).
A group of Banī Hāshim, such as Ḥasan ibn Ḥasan
Aftas, narrate, “On the day of Sayyid Muḥammad’s
death, I went to Imām al-Hādī (ʿa). They had made food
and were hosting people as they would come in and express their condolences to Imām
al-Hādī (ʿa). Close to 150 descendants of Abī Ṭālīb, the Banī Hāshim, and the Quraysh
were present. All of a sudden, Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) entered the house grieving the
death of his brother and stood next to his father. We did not recognize the young Imām.
After some time, Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) turned to Imām al-ʿAskarī and said:

ً َْ ْ َ َ َ َ ْ ََ ً ْ ُ
ُّ َ َ َّ َ‫َ ُ ی‬
‫هلل شکرا فقد أحدث ِفيکِ أمرا‬
‫یاب‬
ِ ‫ن أح ِدث‬

O my son! Thank Allah, as He has blessed you with a bounty.
Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) cried and said:

َّ َ َ ْ َ َ ُ َ َ ُ ُ ْ َ ُ ِّ َ ْ‫َ ِّ ْ َ َ ن‬

ُ ْ ْ‫َ ح‬

ِِ‫الَمد هل‬
ِ ‫ل و إنا إِل ِه ر‬

All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds! We thank him for blessing us, and surely we are
from Allah, and surely we are returning to Him.
I asked, “Who is this?”
Someone replied, “Ḥasan (ʿa), the son of Imām ʿAlī an-Naqi (ʿa).”
He seemed about 20 years old. We realized that after Imām al-Hādī (ʿa), he would be the
Imām.

Gravesites of the ʿAskarīyayn (ʿa) household
It is said that the graves of some Sādāt (Prophet’s descendants) are located in Sāmarrā:

Sawsan (Mother of Imām Ḥasan al ʿAskari (ʿa))
Sawsan is the grandmother of Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj), and has therefore been referred to
as the “Jaddah” as well. This noble and pious lady is also sometimes known as Hādīth,
Hādīthe, Salīl, and Reyhānah. She passed away in 262 AH and was buried in her house.

Ḥaḍrat Narjis Khātūn (Mother of Imām Zamān (ʿaj))
Narjis Khātūn was the mother of Imām az-Zamān (ʿaj). This noble lady was the daughter
of Yashūʿā, son of the Roman Caesar, and was brought to Sāmarrā as a slave. Imām alHādī (ʿa) purchased her and married her to his son Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa). Her Roman
name is Malika, and through her mother, her lineage traces back to Shamūn, the successor
of Prophet ʿĪsā (ʿa). After embracing Islam, she changed her name to Narjis. She passed
away in 260 AH and and was buried in her house in Sāmarrā, next to Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa).

Sayyid Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī (Brother of Imām Ḥasan al ʿAskarī (ʿa))
Muḥaddith Qumī writes in Mafatiḥ al-Janān:
I have not found any bio about this great Sayyid; however, it can be concluded from some
narrations that our Leader compared Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) and his brother, Ḥusayn
ibn ʿAlī (ʿa), to the two holy sons of the Holy Prophet (ṣ): Imām Ḥasan (ʿa) and Imām Ḥusayn
(ʿa). It has also been mentioned in the Hādīth of Abu al-Ṭayyib that Imām az-Zamān’s (ʿaj)
voice was like the voice of his uncle Ḥusayn.
Sayyid Ḥusayn believed in the Imāmate of his brother Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) and was

Gravesites of the ʿAskarīyayn (ʿa) household 415
among his followers. He was known as one of the most devoted and ascetic people of his
time. He was buried near the foot section of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) and ImāmʿAskarī (ʿa).

Jaʿfar al-Kadhāb (Brother of Imām Ḥasan al ʿAskarī (ʿa))
Abu ʿAbdillah Jaʿfar is another son of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa). They say Jaʿfar was not a pious
person and was given the title al-Kadhāb, which means the liar. Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) says
about his son Jaʿfar, “Stay away from my son Jaʿfar; his relationship to me is like the
relationship of Kanʿan to Prophet Nūḥ (ʿa).”
Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) said, “The example of Jaʿfar and I is like Qābīl and Hābīl, the
two sons of Prophet Ādam (ʿa). If it were possible, Jaʿfar would have killed me, but Allah did
not allow him to do so.”
After the martyrdom of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa), Jaʿfar claimed the Imāmate. He went to the
current khalīfah of the time and told him, “I will send you 2,000 ʿAshrafī if your order the
Imāmate to be transferred from my brother to me.”
The khalīfah replied, “If the position of Imāmate was in our hands, we would have taken it and
guarded it for ourselves. If the Shīʿāh see miracles and generosity from you as they saw from
your father and brother, they will choose you as their Imām, and you will not need our help.”
After the martyrdom of Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa), Jaʿfar once again attempted to claim the
Imāmate and lead his brother's funeral prayers, but the young Imām al-Mahdī (ʿaj) came
forward and led his father's prayers instead, making it clear that he was the final Imām.
It has been narrated in Biḥār al-Anwār from Tafsri Ayyashi from Mufazil ibn Amr that Imām
aṣ-Ṣadiq (ʿa) was asked about the following āyah:

ْ َْ ْ ْ َ
َ ْ َ َّ َ‫َّ يَ ُ ْ ن‬
َ
ْ
‫تاب إِال لؤ ِمن بِ ِه قبل موتِ ِه‬
ِ ‫و ِإن ِمن أه ِل ال‬
ِ ‫ك‬

And there is no one from the People of the Book except that he will surely believe in him
before his death. (4:159)
The Imām (ʿa) replied:

َ ُ
‫اهلل َعليْنا‬
‫هلل لقد آثرك‬
ِ ‫المامه بإمامته کما أقر ودل یعقوب یلوسف قالوا تا‬

"This ayah has been revealed for us. Indeed, no son of Lady Fāṭimah (ʿa) will leave this
world without acknowledging the Imām of his time, just like the sons of Yaʿqūb confessed
the prophecy of Yūsuf and said, “They said, ‘By Allah, Allah has certainly preferred you
over us, and we have indeed been erring."

Ḥaḍrat Samānah (Mother of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa))
Ḥaḍrat Samānah is the mother of Imām al-Hādī (ʿa) and is known as “Umm al-Faḍl (mother
of Grace)” and “Sayyidah.” She was among the righteous, wise, and ascetic women of her
time who would fast most of the days and pray through the nights. She passed away in
Imām al-Hādī’s (ʿa) house and was buried there alongside her son.

Abū Hāshim Jaʿfarī
Dawūd ibn Qāsim, son of Ishāq ibn ʿAbdullah ibn Jaʿfar ibn Abi Ṭālib, known as Abu Hāshim, is
a descendent of Jaʿfar at-Tayyār. The lineage of this noble man from his mother can be traced
back to Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr. He was a companion of Imām ar-Riḍā (ʿa), Imām al-Jawād
(ʿa), Imām al-Hādī (ʿa), and Imām al-ʿAskarī (ʿa). His grave is also inside of the holy shrine.

Gravesites of the ʿAskarīyayn (ʿa) household 417

Jamīl ibn Darrāj Kūfī
Jamīl ibn Darrāj is among the trustworthy narrators (ath-thiqā) who has narrated ahādīth
through Zurārāh from Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa) and Imām Mūsā al-Kaẓim (ʿa).
His tomb is in Dajil, in the Tarimiya village on the right side of Baghdad’s main road, about
12 km away from Baghdad and close to the Tigris River.

Ibrāhīm ibn Mālik al-Ashtar
Abū Nuʾman Ibāhīm, the brave son of Mālik al-Ashtar, was the commander of Mukhtār’s
army. He was raised by his father, and despite his young age, he participated in the Battle
of Ṣiffīn alongside his father and Amīr al-Muʾminīn (ʿa). Ibrāhīm rose against the khalīfah
of his time, ʿAbdul Malik Marwān, and took over Baṣrah, Kūfah, and other parts of Iraq.
He was able to defeat the khalīfah’s army and kill their commanders, such as ʿUbaydullāh
ibn Zīyād, Shimr ibn Dhiʾl-Jawshan, Hurmalah, and Khūlī.
After Mukhtār was martyred, Ibrāhīm remained as the leader of Mosul, Jazīrah, Azerbaijan,
and Armenia until ʿAbdul Malik attacked Iraq in 72 AH. When his commander ran away, the
Iraqi army was defeated, and Ibrāhīm was surrounded. Despite his great resistance, they
were able to martyr Ibrāhīm and send his head to ʿAbdul Mālik, who then burnt his body.
Ibrāhīm was martyred on the 13th of Jamādī ul-Awwal in Dayr al-Jathaliq, which is south of
Dujail, and was buried there as well. This grave is known as Shaykh Ibrāhīm today.
Allāmah Majlisī: Ibrāhīm did not have any doubt in his faith. He did not go astray in his
belief and never lost his certainty. He participated in avenging the blood of Imām Ḥusayn
(ʿa). He was a loyalist of the Prophet (ṣ) and Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa), and their flagbearer.

Duʿā al-Faraj
This duʿā is attributed to Imām al-Māhdī (ʿaj). Our ʿulamāʾ recommend that we recite it
often and that reciting it brings immediate help from our living Imām. Al-Kafāmī says in
his book Balad al-Amīn that if a wrongfully confined prisoner recites this duʿā, he will
soon be set free. If a person find himself surrounded by misfortunes, he should recite this
duʿā to overcome difficult situations and crises.
In the name of Allah, the Most
Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
My God, the calamity has been
aggravated, the absence prolonged.
The curtain of modesty has been lifted,
hope has been curtailed.
The earth has become narrow, and the
sky has been blocked.
You are the One from whom help is
sought and complaints are made,
and in You we trust during the times of
difficulty.
O Allah! Send blessings upon Muḥammad
and the progeny of Muḥammad.
You have enjoined upon us obedience
to the possessors of authority,

Imām aṣ-Ṣādiq (ʿa) has narrated that “One who recites this supplication for 40
[consecutive] mornings will be counted amongst the helpers of Imām al-Mahdī (ʿaj). And if
he happens to die before the reappearance of Imām al-Mahdī (ʿaj), Allah will raise him out
of his grave so that he may assist the holy Imam (ʿaj). For every word that he recites in this
supplication, Allah will grant him 1,000 good deeds and erase 1,000 sins from his book of
deeds.”1

O Allah, construct Your lands and revive
Your servants through him,
for surely You have said —and Your
words are the truth – "Corruption will be
apparent in the land and sea by the hands
of what mankind has done." (30:41)
So, show us, O Allah, Your close guardian,
and the son of the daughter of Your Prophet,
the namesake of Your Messenger, may
Allah's blessings be upon him and his family,
so that he shall tear up any wrong item
that he will face and shall confirm and
approve of the truth.
And make him, O Allah, the shelter for
Your oppressed servants,
and a helper for anyone who does not
have any helper except You,
and the reviver of the laws of Your book
that have been suspended,

O Allah, delight Your Prophet Muḥammad, may

Duʿā Tawassul
Shaykh Tusi has narrated in his book al-Miṣbāḥ, that Imām Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī (ʿa) wrote
this duʿā for Abū Muḥammad, who requested him to teach him the proper way of reciting
ṣalawāt. Allāmāh Majlisī has narrated this duʿā on the authority of Shaykh al-Sudūq,
who confidently says that there is no difficulty or problem that this duʿā does not solve.
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent,
the Most Merciful
O Allah, surely I ask You and turn
towards You,
through Your Prophet, the Prophet
of Mercy, Muḥammad, may Allah's
blessings be upon him and his family.
O Abā Qāsim! O Messenger of Allah!
O leader of mercy!
O our chief and master!
Certainly, we turn towards you, seeking

Ziyārat Āli Yāsīn
Shaykh Tūsī narrates in Sharīf Iḥtijāj that Imām al-Mahdī (ʿaj) said, "Whenever you
desire to reach Allah through us and wish to turn your attention towards us, then recite
this ziyārah."
Peace be upon the family of Yāsīn.
Peace be upon you, O caller of Allah and the
manifestation of His signs.
Peace be upon you, O the door of Allah and
the devout one of His religion. Peace be
upon you, O the representative of Allah and
the supporter of His truth.
Peace be upon you, O the proof of Allah and
the guide towards His will. Peace be upon
you, O the reciter and interpreter of Allah's
book.

Peace be upon you in your night and in your
day. Peace be upon you, O the remnant of
Allah on His earth.

Conclusion
Dear Zāʿir,
You have reached the conclusion of your spiritual journey and attained the
lofty status of a zāʿir. According to aḥādīth, for 40 days after completing your
ziyārāt, angels do tawāf around you. For 40 days, you are the qiblah for the
angels, and thus, you become the qiblah of guidance. Take advantage of
this opportunity by demonstrating love and obedience to the Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa)
through your words and actions.
It is important to remember that the ḥarams of the Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa) are symbols.
Their true place is in the hearts of the believers. Performing ziyārah is a chance
for us to rekindle our love and obedience towards our beloved Maʿṣūmīn.
Coming to their graves and performing their ziyārah was a means for us to
rejuvenate our love and connection with them, but as we return home, they
are just as close to us, as long as we maintain our proximity towards them
and continue to build that connection. Seize that spiritual connection you are
feeling right now and strive towards maintaining this feeling after you return
home. How can you do this?
• Resolve to bring about a change within yourself that will help you maintain
the spiritual fervor that comes with a successful ziyārah trip.
• Keep a good relationship with the masjid or your local Islamic center,

and attend gatherings frequently. As we have in our aḥādīth, "A believer
in the masjid is like a fish in water."1
Spend time with scholars and those who have dedicated their lives to
the dīn.
Hold majālis and gatherings of muʾminīn in your home with the
remembrance of Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa).
Keep the remembrance of Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa) alive in your homes by
celebrating their wilādāt and commemorating their shahādāt with fervor.
Strive toward Allah as a family by establishing jamāʿah prayers and
calling the adhān and ʿiqāmah aloud in your home.

Above all, ask Allah, through the intercession of the Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa), to help
you remain steadfast on the path of the Ahl al-Bayt (ʿa) and strive in His way.
With Duʾās,
Nabi R. Mir (Abidi)
